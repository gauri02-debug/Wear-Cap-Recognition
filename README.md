Install Required Libraries:
1. You'll need to install OpenCV and any additional libraries you plan to use. You can install them using pip:
pip install opencv-python numpy
2. Capture Video Feed:
Use OpenCV to capture the video feed from the camera:

3. Implement a function to detect if someone is wearing a cap. You can use a pre-trained machine learning model for this task. For simplicity, let's assume you have a function is_wearing_cap that takes an image and returns True if a cap is detected, and False otherwise.
4. Highlight and Capture Image:
Modify the video feed loop to highlight the person if they are not wearing a cap, capture the image, and save it:

5. Send Image via Email:
If you want to send the captured image via email, you can use the smtplib library to send an email with the image attachment.
# Use send_email('captured_image.jpg') to send the email
This is a basic outline to get you started. Depending on your requirements, you may need to modify and enhance the code.
